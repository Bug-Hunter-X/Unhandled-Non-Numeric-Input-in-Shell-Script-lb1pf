# Unhandled Non-Numeric Input in Shell Script

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in shell scripting: the failure to handle non-numeric input when performing arithmetic operations.  The `bug.sh` script attempts to sum numbers from a file, but crashes if the file contains any non-numeric data. The solution script demonstrates how to improve this using error handling.
